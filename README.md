## Installation

Required: Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize. 

## Usage

Using "npm i", you will have to install all required dependencies and then continue on by using MySQL to sign in and run the schema.sql. Once loaded, you'll have to seed the database using "node run seeds/index.js." After the database is seeded, you can run "nonrun "node server.js." Once the server is running, you may use Insomnia to view the database and make changes (GET/PUT/POST/DEL.)
